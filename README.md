# Spice_Py_restaurant
This Python program simulates a simple restaurant ordering system where users can choose from a menu, order multiple items, and view their total bill. Features include greeting based on time, menu selection, order confirmation, and error handling. The user can order as many times as they like, with the final total displayed at the end.
